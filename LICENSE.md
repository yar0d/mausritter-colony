# What makes it Mausritter?

Mausritter is about small-scale adventurers in a huge world. Mouse adventurers who take on big challanges and face down grave danger.

Make it small and dense. Leave liminal space to be filled by the players.

Mausritter can sometimes contain dark themes under the surface, but don't publish anything that contains sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic or hateful content and tropes.

## Website listing
We love to feature the creativity and work of Mausritter's community!
